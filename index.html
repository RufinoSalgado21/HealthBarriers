    <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>

    <p>This project involved preprocessing datasets of patient demographic information (primary languages, income levels, etc.) and medical history (visit information, case management notes, etc.). The resulting dataset was used to train multilabel and multiclass classification models. Their predictions and correlational relationships between features were used to determine the most influential factors in predicting <strong>barriers to healthcare</strong>, <strong>actions taken in response</strong> by providers, and the <strong>intensity of visits</strong> for patients. These results were also used to provide suggestions for future work on building predictive models for healthcare providers.</p>

    <h2 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h2>

    <p>Datasets were provided by Northwestern researchers and healthcare providers. Four datasets were provided: two describing patients from DuPage county and two describing patients from the Chinatown neighborhood in Chicago. Each pair of datasets including one dedicated to patient demographic information and the other for medical histories.</p>

    <p>Datasets for each location had to be merged according to patient ID’s to ensure each patient would have a complete set of data to analyze. In total, <strong>674</strong> complete sets of patient data.</p>

    <p>In order to merge all datasets into one consolidated set, data had to be reformated for each feature to have consistent values. To extract further features from existing data, the Google Maps API was used with patients’ zip code information to determine nearest hospitals, distance to those hospitals, and predicted travel times. Lists of three most frequent barriers encountered by each patient were created as validation data for model training. The same was done for actions taken by healthcare providers. The number of individual visits recorded per patient were also counted as validation data for multiclass model training.</p>

    <p>The merged dataset consisted of <strong>12 features</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>age</li>
        <li>primary language</li>
        <li>birth country</li>
        <li>marital status</li>
        <li>education level</li>
        <li>household size</li>
        <li>income level</li>
        <li>employment status</li>
        <li>visit count</li>
        <li>distance to a hospital in km</li>
        <li>predicted driving time to hospital</li>
        <li>predicted public transit time to hospital</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
    <p>A multilabel classification model was trained using the dataset to predict the three most likely barriers to healthcare patients and another was trained to predict the three most likely action needed to be taken.
        The model was set up using <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>Keras API</strong>. The multilabel models used were neural networks consisting of Convolutional layers, MaxPooling layers, Dense layers, and Dropout layers.
        The multiclass classification of visit intensity was done with a Support Vector Machine algorithm, specifically the LinearSVC function. Average performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores) were calculated
        over the course of a K-fold cross validation. These average metrics were determined for individual barrier and action classes as well as for all classes as a whole.</p>

            <div class="numbertext"><h4>Notable Correlations Between Features and Barriers</h4></div>
            <p >Correlational relationships between features and the barriers reported by patients suggest primary languages have the strongest relationships with the most frequent barriers. Some of these, including being <strong>Uncomfortable Communicating in English</strong> and a <strong>Lack of Healthcare Staff Speaking Their Native Language</strong>, were understandably related to patients' primary languages. However, it's also a major indicator of other frequent barriers listed such as <strong>Case Management</strong>, cases where patients listed complications which did not fit in other barrier categories. Specifically, patients who were English speakers were the most likely to report this issue and Chinese speakers reported it the least. It can be inferred that a patient's comfort with English can rule out many possible barriers when considering <strong>Case Management</strong> as an alternative to other barriers. </p>
            <p>It is through these correlations that redundancies can be seen in the demographic information gathered and in the barriers being recorded. Two of the most frequent barriers reported, <strong>Uncomfortable speaking English</strong> and <strong>Lack of Healthcare Staff Speaking Their Native Language</strong>, have strong associations with primary languages other than English. Taking into account only the first class would make it seem that <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong> patients are the least likely to encounter language barriers. However, their correlations with the second class indicates the opposite. It is clear that a patient's primary language or birth country, both important aspects of their cultural backgrounds, are the largest indicators of potential barriers faced in the areas being observed. However, having multiple barriers patients could report representing similar issues potentially confuse patients or misrepresent their encounters with healthcare. Consolidating similar barrier classes is something to consider for future work in analyzing patient data and in training predictive models</p>

            <div class="numbertext"><h4>Notable Correlations Between Features and Actions</h4></div>
            <p>Among the <strong>Actions Taken</strong> classes, the strongest positive correlation between these and patient demographics was the relationship between having a <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong> and <strong>Accompaniment to Health Services</strong>. It appears this service is tied to reduced reporting of several barriers by Chinese-speaking patients, as demonstrated by several barrier classes having their most negatively correlated relationships with the <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong>. This is also reflected in several other <strong>Actions Taken</strong> classes having a negative correlation with a <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong>. </p>
            <p>This might be an indicator that <strong>Accompaniment to Health Services</strong> replaces several other services patients might require including interpreter services, post-visit communication for reminders or further information, and transportation. This could be due to those accompanying patients also likely providing translation and transportation assistance. By potentially encompassing several services for patients, <strong>Accompaniment to Health Services</strong> might also be removing barriers to healthcare before they ever become an issue for patients, thereby leading to individuals with a <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong> being the least likely to report many of these obstacles. Therefore, efforts to provide similar services for patients in other areas lacking them would have a significantly positive effect on patients' interactions with healthcare.</p>

            <div class="numbertext"><h4>Notable Correlations Between Features</h4></div>
            <p>Correlations between patient demographic features affirms the presence of redundant feature categories. As evidenced by the correlations between <strong>Birth Countries</strong>  and <strong>Primary Languages</strong>, such as between Spanish-speakers and Mexican-born patients, certain pairings of these features are likely to appear together among patients.  It is possible this is due to them being aspects of the a patient's cultural background. Because of this, future work with patient demographic data could consider removing one of these features or creating a new feature which more accurately describes a patient's culture.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Spanish Primary Language</strong> patients tended to report higher amounts of <strong>Visits</strong>, especially in comparison to <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong> patients, as seen by their negative correlation to number of visits. Because of these, primary languages also appear to be a strong predictor of future visit intensity for patients. Reasons patients with a <strong>Spanish Primary Language</strong> could be more likely to experience higher visit counts might be related to other features these patients tend to share. <strong>Spanish Primary Language</strong> among patients is more likely to appear along with a higher <strong>Household Size</strong>, the number of people living in the same home, and a lower income level, most frequently between <strong>$10,000 to $19,999</strong>. Together, these clues suggest that because of the financial burden of maintaining larger households and the limitations of their income, Spanish-speaking patients required more medical services in the long run. Possibly a result of foregoing early treatment for medical condition to avoid costs, this would lead to more severe illnesses for these patients and therefore more encounters with healthcare providers.

            <div class="numbertext"><h4>Barrier Predictions</h4></div>
            <p>Training a multilabel neural network on the data produced a graph representing the set of correct and incorrect predictions for each barrier. For instance, the three most common barriers reported were <strong>None</strong>, <strong>Uncomfortable with English</strong>, and <strong>Case Management</strong>. As shown in the graph according to their respective colors in the legend, the model largely predicted these classes correctly when they occurred. However, their overwhelming frequency appears to have skewed the data and the model's results. Because of this, barriers which appear less than those visible in the graph (many with single digit appearances) were consistently misclassified and therefore excluded to focus on the most common barriers</p>
                <p>This skew presents itself among predictions for other classes as a large portion of their incorrect predictions belong to the three most common barriers (in purple, yellow, and green). To counter act the influence of this skewed data, future data collection should place an emphasis on including patients who encountered the less common barriers to train the model on.</p>
            <p>This graph also demonstrates the effect of having multiple barrier classes representing similar ideas. A significant portion of <strong>Uncomfortable with English</strong> predictions were misclassified as <strong>Staff Does Not Speak Native Language</strong> and vice-versa. Their misclassifications serve as an example of how redundant barrier classes can lead to confusion in a model's predictions.

            <div class="numbertext"><h4>Actions Taken Predictions</h4></div>
            <p><strong>Actions Taken</strong> classes were more evenly represented in the data than barriers. The most commonly reported action, <strong>Accompaniment to Health Service</strong>, is the most accurately predicted. This is possibly due to having the greatest number of examples to train the model or its strong association with <strong>Chinese Primary Language</strong> patients. However, other classes were predicted with less accuracy. Most classes were predicted incorrectly more often than not. For example, with the second most common class, <strong>Call Patient</strong>, more than half of its cases were misclassified as one of six other classes.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, these classes suffer from redundancies similar to the barrier classes and could also be reduced into broader categories. Several <strong>Actions Taken</strong> involving contacting patients for the purposes of providing a service or verifying information, including <strong>Call Patient</strong>, <strong>Scheduling and Rescheduling Appointments</strong>, requesting <strong>Consent or Exiting Patients</strong>, <strong>Appointment/Information Verification</strong>, and  providing <strong>Emotional Support/Active Learning</strong>. Though there is a greater distribution of classes in the data, similarities between the listed classes led to their misclassification as one another.Therefore, the list of potential <strong>Actions Taken</strong> classes would also benefit from reducing actions involving communicating with patients into those requesting information and those providing a service.
